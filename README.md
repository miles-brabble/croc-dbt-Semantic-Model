# üêä croc-dbt-Semantic-Model

This project is a working example of a **dbt + MetricFlow + Streamlit** semantic modeling environment ‚Äî designed to demonstrate how structured and governed data models can power intelligent reporting and experimentation on top of a semantic layer.

---

## üß† Overview

The `croc-dbt-Semantic-Model` project represents a simple analytics workflow that:
- Loads and transforms structured data (in this case, crocodile observation data) via **dbt**.
- Defines a **semantic layer** using MetricFlow YAML for governed metrics, entities, and dimensions.
- Exposes those metrics through a **Streamlit app** for exploration, testing, or API integration.

This setup is ideal for experimenting with **headless BI**, **AI-ready data models**, or **semantic APIs**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|
| Transformation | **dbt-core** | SQL models for cleaning, joining, and structuring data |
| Semantic Layer | **MetricFlow** | Defines metrics, entities, and relationships in YAML |
| Visualization / Interface | **Streamlit** | Simple app interface for querying and testing semantic metrics |
| Storage (example) | **Postgres / Neon / Snowflake** | Data warehouse for model outputs |
